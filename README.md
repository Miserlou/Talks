# Talks

Assorted talks and presentations I have given, mostly made in the supremely awesome [Big](https://github.com/tmcw/big).

You can see any of the talks by opening the HTML in your browser, or by entering the GitHub URL into [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/), like [this](https://rawgit.com/Miserlou/Talks/master/zappa-djangocon-2017/djangocon.html#0).
